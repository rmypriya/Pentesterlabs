API 01
Task: 
In this lab, we have to collect and submit the key which is stored as \'secret\' in the \'Admin\' account.
 Solution: 
1. First we have to sign up with our credentials.
2. After a successful login, we are able to see a category called \'New Secret\' in the dashboard. While clicking on
that \'new secret\' we can create and store a secret value. 
3. When we press the \'home\' button we may able to see the secrets which the authenticated user creates. 
4. While viewing the secrets we can see a path \'/secret/2\' in the URL. So, here we just capture this request in the proxy change the path to \'/seret/1\', and get the 200 ok status code, through which we get the \'secret key\' for the user \'admin\'.

API 02
Task:
In this lab also, we have to collect and submit the key which is stored as \'secret\' in the \'Admin\' account.
 Solution: 
1. Here I tried the same technique that we used to solve the previous lab but got \'403 forbidden\' in the response.
2. We can see that they use a JWT bearer token for authentication. In that JWT Token, the payload part contains only the \'ID\' parameter.
3. So we have to change the \'ID\' value from \'2\' to \'1\', then click apply changes and send the request.
4. The server didn't verify the signature of the JWT token, So we got the \'200 ok\' status code and got the \'key\' for the admin user.

API 03 
Task: In this lab also, we have to collect and submit the key which is stored as \'secret\' in the \'Admin\' account. 
 Solution: 
1. Here I tried the same technique that we used to solve the previous labs but got \'403 forbidden\' in the response.
2. This server checks and verifies the signature of the JWT token, So the only way to get the \'key\' which is stored in the admin user is to find out the \'secret key\' of the JWT token.
3. We can find out that \'secret key\' by using the \'John the repper\' tool in Kali Linux, and we found the secret key for the JWT token as \'secret\'.
4. Then we have to change the \'ID\' value from \'2\' to \'1\' in the payload part of the JWT token and sign them with the found \'secret\' key. Now we are able to get the \'key\' from the admin user.

API 04 
Task: 
The challenge is to review the javascript of the page to find out the hidden endpoint where we get the \'key\' to solve this lab.
 Solution: 
1. We were given a hint to check the HTML Page to get the angular application name and with that application name we able to find
the hidden endpoint.
2. The angular application name is \'approval\' and now we have to view the \'js\' file and findout the hidden endpoint as \'/get_secret\' of that angular application. Note: The hidden endpoint \'get_secret\' is only accessible for the post request.

API 05 
Task: 
Here also the challenge is to review the javascript of the
page to find out the hidden endpoint but here the code is in the
compressed format. 
 Solution: 
1. We were given a hint to check the HTML Page to get the angular application name and with that application name we were able to find the hidden endpoint.
2. The angular application name is \'approval\' and now we have to view the \'js\' file and find out the hidden endpoint of that angular application as \'/get_more_secret\'.
Note: The hidden endpoint \'get_more_secret\' is only accessible for the post request.

API 06
Task: 
The challenge is to review the javascript of the page to
find out the hidden endpoint but here we have to send our request with
right header and cookies to get the \'key\'. 
 Solution: 
1. In this lab, we get the hidden endpoint as \'/get_secret\' for that angular application by using similar techniques that we have used in the previous labs.
2. When we tried to reach the hidden endpoint \'/get_secret\', we received \'422 uprocessable entity\' rails error message for CSRF protection in the response. In the challenge itself, they mentioned using the right header and cookies to get the \'key\'.
3. So we have to set the csrf token in our request to get the \'key\'. From the js file, we are able to see the csrf header as \'X-XSRF-TOKEN\' and we get the csrf token by viewing the source page.
Note: The hidden endpoint \'/get_secret\' is only accessible for the post request.

API 07 
Task: 
The challenge for this lab is to review the javascript of
the page to find an information leak. 
 Solution: 
1. Here the information is leaked in the js file. We can get the key by simply searching for the
keywords like approval, keys, etc.

API 08 
Task: 
In this lab, the information is leaked in the HTTP response through which we have to log in as admin to get the \'key\'.
 Solution: 
1. The admin mail ID is given on the login page itself and has the forget password functionality. Once click on the \'forget password\'
button, we can able to see the password reset URL in the response.
2. Copy that \'reset password\' URL and paste it into the browser to set a new password for the admin user. After changing the password, we were able to log in as admin and get the key.

API 09 
Task: 
Similar to the previous lab, here also the information is leaked in the HTTP response through which we have to log in as admin to get the \'key\'. 
 Solution: 
1. Here also we followed the same technique that we used to solve the previous lab but here the \'reset
password\' URL is not shown in the response. So we simply change the version from V2 to V1 in the path and are able to get the \' reset password\' URL.

API 10 
Task: 
The challenge is to register a user as an admin so we can get the \'key\'. 
 Solution: 
1. As given in the hint we are going to sign up as admin with \'@libcurl.so\' domain but we couldn't signup because it also prevents us from registering with libcurl. so email address.
2. So here we are going to bypass the validation, simply by using \'admin@libcurl.so@gmail.com\' and signing in as admin.

API 11 
Task: 
The challenge is to register a user as \'admin\' and so we are able to get the \'key\'. 
 Solution: 
1. We going to follow the same techniques that we are used to solve the previous lab but here we have to use \'.\' instead of \'@\' to bypass the validation.

API 12 
Task: 
Here also we have to sign up as admin to get the \'key\' and solve the lab. 
 Solution: 
1. The same techniques are used here which we used to solve the previous labs but here we have to replace anyone of the characters in \'libcurl.so\' with any special character and so we logged in as admin and got the \'key\'.

API 13 
Task: 
The challenge here is to sign up and log in as admin in order to get the \'key\'. 
 Solution: 
1. We first tried to sign up using this \'admin@libcurl.so\' mail address but due to client and server-side validation, we couldn't sign up using \'libcurl.so\' address.
2. So we tried the same techniques that we used to solve the previous lab but here we can use case-sensitive alphabets to bypass the validation and finally log in as admin and get the key.

API 14 
Task: 
In this lab, we have to log in as admin by bypassing the hashed password. 
 Solution: 
1. Here we first simply give the admin credentials with some random password and intercept the request to change the password value with the hashed password, and finally we log in and get the \'key\'.

API 15 
Task: 
In this lab, we have to find the \'key\' with the leaked information on the login page. 
 Solution: 
1. While viewing the login page we can see the login credentials for admin users get leaked.
2. Here the admin\'s password is encrypted, we have to decrypt the password to get the \'key\'.
3. By viewing the source code for the login page, we are able to get the encryption and decryption key and finally decrypt the
password to get the key.

API PAYMENTS 01 
Task: 
In this challenge, we were able to get the \'key\' by simply bypassing the payment functionality. 
 Solution: 
1. First add some items to the cart and once we click on the \'checkout\' we are redirected to the payment page. 2. In the backend we can see an API that carries the payment successful URL. We have to just decode that URL and paste it in the browser to get the \'key\'.

API PAYMENTS 02 
Task: 
This one is just similar to the previous lab but here we have to bypass the payment amount. 
 Solution: 
1. Here also we use the same method that we used to solve the previous lab, but here we have to intercept the payment request change the amount to 0, and send the request. After the successful payment, we are redirected to a page where we get our \'key\' to solve the lab.

API PAYMENT 03 
Task: 
The challenge here is to get the \'key\' by bypassing the payment functionality. 
 Solution: 
1. In this lab we couldn't reduce the amount like the previous one. So here we tried to reduce the quantity to some negative value through which we were able to reduce the total amount and get the \'key\'.

API PAYMENT 04 
Task: 
Our task is to get the \'key\' after a successful payment by using the voucher \'HACKTHEPLANET\'. 
 Solution: 
1. First we have to add some items to our cart and apply the voucher code \'HACKTHEPLANET\' before the checkout.
2. Since we can send multiple voucher requests to the server because the server didn't validate properly.

API PAYMENT 06 
Task: 
We have to get the \'key\' by bypassing the payment functionality. 
 Solution: 
1. In this lab also we have to use the same techniques that we used to solve the \'API payment 03\' but here instead of using some negative values in the quantity field, this time we tried some decimal values(0.01) and so we reduced the total amount.

API PAYMENT 07 

Task: The challenge here is to get the \'key\' by bypassing the payment functionality. 
 Solution: 
1. First we have to add items to the cart and on the intercept to capture the checkout requests.
2. In that request we tried to change the price value and send the request through which we completed the payment and got the \'key\'.

MONGO IDOR 
Task: 
The task is to get the key which is stored in the admin user to solve this lab. 
 Solution: 
1. While we loading the page we can see the user credentials like mail address & username.
2. When checking the backend API request, we are able to see some \'id\' for each user.
3. We then add the admin\'s \'id\' in the URL and get the key for this lab.
